#Ant and Gradle Feature Exploration

This is an exploration of the features of Ant and Gradle, two ways of implementing Buildmanagement. This exploration is part of my studies at the BHT (Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Technik).

There is a description of the both build files ('build.xml' for Ant and 'build.gradle' for Gradle) in the 'documentaion.pdf', written in german.
